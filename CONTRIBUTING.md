# Contributing to Startrack
First off, well done for getting here, and thank you for taking the time to contribute to my project. You're amazing!

#### Create an issue first
Please use the feature request template, and tell us you're happy to handle this in a PR. This is usually fine, but wait for the `needs triage` label to be removed first. If it's a minor fix, go ahead and create the PR without creating an issue.

#### Commit Convention
Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this repository. When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention. You can see the possible emojis on their website, and you can use the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seatonjiang.gitmoji-vscode) to easily add them to your commit message. Please don't use other emojis. Use this format:
```
[EMOJI] [COMMIT MESSAGE]
```
**Please only use one emoji per commit message. It should be placed at the start, and seperated from the text with a space.**
